# Silence
 A stealth game  demo in development which is currently in early stage.

In the original idea, the main gameplay was based on hearing and limited vision.

The reason for starting this project was to preserve the results of another project Alien Stalker, which took me a lot of time and has been shelved. Originally this game would make greatly simplified and refix to  Alien Stalker's problem , but now the designs of the two games seem to have no similarities.


In the early demo, the effect was not as interesting as I expected, so the project is currently on hold. The updated code does not provide a playable part.
